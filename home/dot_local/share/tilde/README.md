# Tilde

Original repo: https://github.com/xvvvyz/tilde.git

Tilde is a minimal browser homepage for pro web surfers.

## Installation

In Firefox, there are 2 distinct settings to set.
To see this startpage when a new browser window is opened or when clicking on the Home button, go to the [preferences page](about:preferences#home) and change the "Homepage and new windows" entry to "Custom URLs..."
The URL should be file:///home/<username>/.local/share/tilde/index.html
To see this startpage when a new tab is opened, you will need to install an extension because the "Custom URLs" feature is not available by default.
The recommended extension is [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)

## Usage

By default, the "Common" section is selected, you can switch to the desired section by typing the corresponding key.

**To go to a site**, type the corresponding key and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

e.g. `g` <kbd>Enter</kbd> will redirect you to

query.

**If your input doesn&rsquo;t match a key**, a DuckDuckGo search will be
triggered.
